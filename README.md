# Spongemock

[![dependency status](https://deps.rs/crate/spongemock/0.1.0/status.svg)](https://deps.rs/crate/spongemock/0.1.0)

A Rust library and CLI-tool for random text capitalization  
(work in progress)

Random capitalization of the letters can be used to convey a mocking tone of voice in written speech.

The name of this library (and the CLI application) is derived from a meme with the same name.
